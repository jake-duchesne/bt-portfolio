<p class="lead">I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a class="text-[#282c3f] decoration-[#83d2e2]" href="https://nikolamotor.com">Nikola</a>, building our cloud telematics application with Ruby on Rails.</p>

I started at Nikola in the early days while we were still a fledgling company fighting to make a name for ourselves. I've worn many hats during that time; doing everything from writing technical documentation and developing internal tooling to helping bring forth our vision on our website.

Now, I'm delivering an impactful product that helps our trucks, their drivers and the teams that support them stay connected, safe and able to focus on what they do best.

One of my core driving principles in life is building a more sustainable future for the next generation and I've been lucky enough to work at the crossroads of clean energy and technology my entire career.

When I'm not writing code, you can find me at the ice rink playing hockey or exploring my current state of Arizona. I thoroughly value disconnecting from the computer to mentally reset and provide balance to my life.

I love to travel, am an avid astrophile and get *way* too excited about a good pi√±a colada.

Most of my time outside of work is spent with my amazing girlfriend and our dog Bondi building our story together.
