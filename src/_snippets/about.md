<p class="lead">I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a class="text-[#282c3f] decoration-[#83d2e2]" href="https://nikolamotor.com">Nikola</a>, building our cloud telematics tool with Ruby on Rails.</p>

I got my start at Nikola as an apprentice on the software team helping to write technical documentation and establish standards and protocols for the organization.

I eventually transitioned to working on our website and began my software development career and haven't looked back.

I helped support our rapidly growing company by developing internal tools, supporting internal team requests and enabling core functions for everything from marketing to engineering.

Within my first year, I was promoted to Software Engineer and began work where I am today.
